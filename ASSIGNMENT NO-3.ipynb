    "# 1.What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "### Ans.\n",
    "### Tuples are ordered collections of elements that are typically used to group related data. The main characteristics of tuples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutable: Tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their contents cannot be modified. This means that you cannot add, remove, or replace elements in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordered: Tuples are ordered, meaning that the order in which the elements appear in the tuple is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types, including integers, floats, strings, and other tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexable: Tuples are indexable, meaning that you can access the elements in a tuple using their position in the tuple. The index of the first element is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterable: Tuples are iterable, meaning that you can use a for loop to iterate over the elements in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Because tuples are immutable, they are often used to represent fixed data structures that should not be changed during the course of a program. Additionally, tuples are sometimes used to return multiple values from a function.\n",

    "# 2.What are the two tuple methods in python? Give an example of each method. Give a reason why tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans.\n",
    "### In Python, there are two built-in methods that can be used with tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### count: This method returns the number of times a specified value appears in a tuple\n",
    "### index: This method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a tuple. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The reason why tuples have only two built-in methods compared to lists is that tuples are designed to be immutable, meaning that their contents cannot be changed. As a result, there is no need for methods like append, insert, or remove, which modify the contents of a list. The two methods provided for tuples allow users to query the contents of a tuple without modifying it. Additionally, because tuples are simpler than lists, they can be more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance."

When you iterate over a dictionary, the order in which the key-value pairs are returned is not guaranteed to be the same every time.

So, while dictionaries are not strictly ordered, they do maintain the order in which elements were added."
